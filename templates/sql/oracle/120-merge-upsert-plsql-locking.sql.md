###### Oracle PL/SQL

### MERGE upsert (clarity over cleverness)
Use a unique key and a straight MERGE; avoid racey SELECT+INSERT combos.


```sql
MERGE INTO accounts d
USING (SELECT :id id, :email email FROM dual) s
ON (d.id = s.id)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET d.email = s.email, d.updated_at = SYSTIMESTAMP
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (id, email, created_at) VALUES (s.id, s.email, SYSTIMESTAMP);
```
